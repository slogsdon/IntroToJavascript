# Intro To Javascript

A primer into programming in Javascript. This assumes you know nothing, and doggone it, that's ok.

#### Resources

- [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - covers HTML, CSS, Javascript, Web APIs, etc. Also contains tutorials, awesome explanations, and demos.
- [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) - question/answer style website. The higher the score of an answer, the more it is accepted as correct and/or best practice, but don't rule out other answers.

#### Tools of the Trade

- Your trusty text editor. I like [SublimeText](http://www.sublimetext.com/), but use what makes you comfortable.
- Any browser worth its weight. Chrome is awesome for development, but if you use something else, make sure your chosen browser has awesome developer tools as they will help you in the future

While it's aimed at devs who already know Javascript, it describes everything you need to know and the reasons for doing things the right way.
